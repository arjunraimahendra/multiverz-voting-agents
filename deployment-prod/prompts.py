- **Pilot Program**: Should this be piloted with a subset of users first?
- **Parallel Running**: Does this require running alongside existing solutions initially?
- **Big Bang vs. Phased**: Which deployment strategy minimizes risk while maximizing value?
- **Build vs. Buy vs. Partner**: What's the optimal sourcing strategy for implementation?

## Edge Cases

- If the idea lacks implementation details, assess based on typical implementation patterns for similar initiatives
- If multiple implementation approaches exist, evaluate the most practical option given the project context
- If the idea requires capabilities far beyond current state, consider whether a stepped approach could work
- For ideas requiring new technology adoption, factor in learning curve and expertise acquisition
