}}
```

## Evaluation Task

### Primary Objective
Evaluate ALL submitted ideas comparatively and provide percentage scores from 0 to 100, ensuring meaningful differentiation between ideas. You must distribute scores across the range to reflect relative differences.

### Comparative Scoring Framework (Weighted: Practicality 50%, Scale of Impact 30%, Innovation 20%)

1. PRACTICALITY (Market Execution) - 50% weight
Evaluate implementation feasibility from a business standpoint:

Market Readiness: Are customers ready to adopt this?
Go-to-Market Complexity: How executable is the market entry strategy?
Resource Requirements: What investment/capabilities are needed?

21-40: Minor variations on existing market offerings
41-60: Moderate innovation with some unique value propositions
61-80: Significant market innovation with clear differentiation
81-100: Breakthrough business innovation that redefines markets

## Comparative Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
Review all ideas to understand the range of innovation, practicality, and scale across the set.

### Step 2: Relative Ranking
For each dimension (Innovation, Practicality, Scale):
1. Rank all ideas from best to worst
2. Identify clear leaders, middle performers, and laggards
3. Note meaningful differences between ideas

### Step 3: Score Distribution
**MANDATORY DISTRIBUTION RULES:**
- The best idea should score between 75-95
- The worst idea should score between 15-40
- Middle ideas should be distributed across the range
- **Minimum 10 point difference** between adjacent ranked ideas
- No two ideas should have the same score
- Use the full scoring range to show relative differences

### Step 4: Final Scoring
Calculate each idea's score: (Innovation × 0.2) + (Practicality × 0.5) + (Scale × 0.3)
Round to the nearest integer. Ensure final scores maintain meaningful separation.

## Output Format

Return a JSON array with one object per idea:

```json
[
  {{
    "ideaId": 123,
    "rating": 85,
    "comment": "[Comprehensive analysis under 100 words]"
  }},
  {{
    "ideaId": 456,
    "rating": 72,
    "comment": "[Comprehensive analysis under 100 words]"
  }},
  ...
]
```

### CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- **ideaId**: MUST be the exact integer ID from the input idea's "id" field
- **rating**: MUST be an integer between 0 and 100 (no percentage sign)
- **comment**: String under 100 words with business analysis
- The array MUST contain exactly one entry for each input idea
- NEVER create or modify idea IDs - use exactly what was provided

### Comment Structure Guidelines
Each comment must be a cohesive narrative (under 100 words) that includes:

1. **Comparative Positioning** (20-30 words): How this ranks versus other ideas and why
2. **Distinctive Strengths** (20-30 words): What makes this idea stand out from others
3. **Relative Weaknesses** (20-30 words): Where this falls short compared to alternatives
4. **Strategic Priority** (10-20 words): Recommendation relative to other options (top priority, secondary option, or deprioritize)

## Evaluation Principles

### DO:
- **Use Exact IDs**: Copy the "id" field exactly as provided for each idea
- **Force Differentiation**: Ensure each idea has a distinct score
- **Use Full Range**: Distribute scores from low to high
- **Compare Directly**: Reference how ideas compare to each other
- **Maintain Consistency**: Apply criteria uniformly across all ideas
- **Highlight Differences**: Emphasize what makes each idea unique
- **Rank Clearly**: Make the relative ranking obvious through scores

### DON'T:
- Create, modify, or hallucinate idea IDs
- Give similar scores to different ideas
- Cluster all scores in a narrow range (e.g., 60-70)
- Evaluate ideas in isolation
- Use percentage signs in ratings
- Mix up which comment belongs to which ID
- Score all ideas as "good" or "moderate"

## ID Mapping Verification Process

Before scoring:
1. Extract the exact "id" field from each input idea
2. Create a mapping of ID to idea content
3. Ensure each output entry corresponds to the correct input idea
4. Double-check that ideaId in output matches the source idea

## Scoring Distribution Guidelines

For a set of **N ideas**, follow this distribution:

### Top Tier (75-95)
- Reserve for the best 20% of ideas
- Clear market leaders with exceptional potential
- Significant gap from next tier

### Upper Middle (55-74)
- Next 30% of ideas
- Strong propositions with good potential
- Clear advantages over lower tiers

### Lower Middle (35-54)
- Middle 30% of ideas
- Adequate but not exceptional
- Some potential but significant limitations

### Bottom Tier (15-34)
- Bottom 20% of ideas
- Weak propositions with limited potential
- Clear disadvantages versus other options

## Comparative Language Guidelines

Use comparative terms in comments:
- "Outperforms other ideas in..."
- "Compared to other proposals, this offers..."
- "Ranks highest/lowest for..."
- "Among the submitted ideas, this is the most/least..."
- "Relative to alternatives, this idea..."
- "Falls behind others in terms of..."

## Quality Checks
Before submitting:
- **Verify each ideaId matches exactly the input "id" field**
- Confirm NO two ideas have the same rating score
- Ensure ratings span at least 40 points (highest - lowest)
- Check that each comment corresponds to the correct ideaId
- Validate all ratings are integers between 0-100
- Ensure each comment is under 100 words
- Verify the number of output entries equals input ideas
- Double-check no IDs were created or modified

## Grounding Rules to Prevent Hallucination

1. **Exact ID Matching**: Use only the provided "id" values, never generate new ones
2. **Relative Assessment**: Score based on comparison within the provided set
3. **No External Benchmarks**: Don't compare to ideas not in the list
4. **Evidence-Based Ranking**: Every ranking decision must be justified by provided information
5. **Consistent Criteria**: Apply the same three criteria uniformly
6. **Forced Distribution**: Must differentiate even if ideas seem similar

## Special Instructions for Edge Cases

- **If all ideas seem similar**: Find subtle differences and amplify them in scoring
- **If quality varies widely**: Use the full 0-100 range to show the gap
- **If ideas target different markets**: Compare potential within respective markets
- **If some ideas lack detail**: Score based on available information, penalizing vagueness
- **If ID format varies**: Always use exactly what's in the "id" field, whether it's 1, 01, 001, etc.

## Example Output (for reference structure only)
```json
[
  {{
    "ideaId": 42,
    "rating": 82,
    "comment": "Leads the pack with revolutionary market approach, outperforming others in innovation and scale. Strong differentiation through unique business model. Limited only by moderate execution complexity versus simpler alternatives. Top priority for implementation."
  }},
  {{
    "ideaId": 17,
    "rating": 68,
    "comment": "Solid second-tier option with better practicality than the leader but less transformative impact. Exceeds lower-ranked ideas in market readiness. Falls short on innovation compared to top choice. Consider as backup strategy."
  }},
  {{
    "ideaId": 203,
    "rating": 45,
    "comment": "Middle performer with average scores across all dimensions. More practical than bottom-tier ideas but lacks the innovation of leaders. Limited scale compared to top options. Secondary priority if resources allow."
  }}
]
```

---

*Remember: CRITICAL - Use exact IDs from input, never create or modify them. Compare ideas AGAINST EACH OTHER, not against an absolute standard. Force meaningful differentiation through scoring. Every idea must have a unique integer rating that reflects its relative position in the set.*

## Comparative Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Initial Impact Assessment
Review all ideas to understand the range of impact innovation, feasibility, and magnitude.

### Step 2: Relative Impact Ranking
For each dimension:
1. Rank ideas by net positive impact potential
2. Identify impact leaders and those with concerning effects
3. Quantify impact differences between ideas

### Step 3: Score Distribution
**MANDATORY DISTRIBUTION RULES:**
- The highest positive impact idea should score between 75-95
- The lowest/negative impact idea should score between 15-40
- Distribute middle ideas across the range
- **Minimum 10 point difference** between adjacent ranked ideas
- No two ideas should have the same score
- Use full range to show relative impact differences

### Step 4: Final Scoring
Calculate each idea's score: (Innovation × 0.2) + (Practicality × 0.5) + (Scale × 0.3)
Round to the nearest integer. Ensure scores reflect clear impact differentiation.

## Output Format

Return a JSON array with one object per idea:

```json

### DON'T:
- Create or modify idea IDs
- Give similar scores to different ideas
- Ignore negative externalities
- Mix up which comment belongs to which ID
- Use percentage signs in ratings
- Evaluate impacts in isolation
- Overlook unintended consequences

## Impact Comparison Language

Use comparative impact terms:
- "Creates deeper positive change than..."
- "Reaches more beneficiaries compared to..."
- "Better addresses root causes versus..."
- "Higher social return relative to..."
- "Stronger sustainability benefits than..."
- "Greater risk of negative impacts compared to..."

## Quality Checks
Before submitting:
- **Verify each ideaId matches exactly the input "id" field**
- Confirm NO two ideas have the same rating
- Ensure ratings span at least 40 points
- Check impact logic in each comment
- Validate all ratings are integers between 0-100
- Ensure each comment is under 100 words
- Verify output count equals input count

## Grounding Rules to Prevent Hallucination

1. **Exact ID Matching**: Use only provided "id" values
2. **Evidence-Based Assessment**: Base on information in summaries
3. **No Invented Metrics**: Don't create specific impact numbers not derivable
4. **Relative Impact Assessment**: Compare within provided set only
5. **Consistent Impact Logic**: Apply same principles uniformly

## Special Instructions for Edge Cases

- **If impact details are vague**: Apply impact assessment best practices
- **If all seem similar in impact**: Amplify subtle differences in beneficiaries or depth
- **If different impact domains**: Normalize to common impact value framework
- **If mix of social/environmental/economic**: Weight equally unless specified
- **If potential for harm exists**: Heavily weight negative impacts in scoring

## Scoring Distribution Guidelines
