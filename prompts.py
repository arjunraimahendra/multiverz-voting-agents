Each idea in the list follows this structure:
```json
{{
  "id_": integer,
  "title": "string",
  "summary": "string",
  "categories": [array of category objects]
}}
```

## Evaluation Task

### Primary Objective
Evaluate ALL submitted ideas comparatively and provide scores from 0 to 5.00, ensuring meaningful differentiation between ideas. Score 0 means the idea should be completely discarded. Scores from 1.00 to 5.00 (using up to two decimal places) are for acceptable ideas. You must distribute scores across the range to reflect relative business merit.

### Comparative Scoring Framework (Weighted: Practicality 50%, Scale of Impact 30%, Innovation 20%)

1. PRACTICALITY (Market Execution) - 50% weight
Evaluate implementation feasibility from a business standpoint:

Market Readiness: Are customers ready to adopt this?
Go-to-Market Complexity: How executable is the market entry strategy?
Resource Requirements: What investment/capabilities are needed?
Time to Revenue: How quickly can this generate returns?

Scoring Guide:

0: Completely unviable - should be discarded
1.00-1.99: Extremely difficult market entry with prohibitive barriers
2.00-2.99: High complexity requiring significant market education/resources
3.00-3.99: Moderate complexity with manageable execution challenges
4.00-4.79: Straightforward implementation with clear market path
4.80-5.00: Immediately executable with existing market infrastructure

2. SCALE OF IMPACT (Market Potential) - 30% weight
Measure the potential business impact:

Total Addressable Market (TAM): Size of the opportunity
Market Growth Potential: Expansion possibilities
Revenue Scalability: Ability to grow revenues exponentially
Market Transformation: Potential to create new markets or categories

Scoring Guide:

0: No viable market - discard
1.00-1.99: Niche market with minimal growth potential
2.00-2.99: Small market segment with limited expansion
3.00-3.99: Moderate market size with regional potential
4.00-4.79: Large market opportunity with strong growth prospects
4.80-5.00: Massive global market with transformative potential

3. INNOVATION (Business Perspective) - 20% weight
Assess the business innovation potential:

Market Differentiation: How unique is this in the marketplace?
Business Model Innovation: Does it introduce new ways to create/capture value?
Competitive Disruption: Does it change market dynamics or customer expectations?
First-Mover Advantage: Can this establish market leadership?

Scoring Guide:

0: Harmful to business - discard
1.00-1.99: Replicates existing business models with no differentiation
2.00-2.99: Minor variations on existing market offerings
3.00-3.99: Moderate innovation with some unique value propositions
4.00-4.79: Significant market innovation with clear differentiation
4.80-5.00: Breakthrough business innovation that redefines markets

## Comparative Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
Review all ideas to understand the range of innovation, practicality, and scale across the set.

### Step 2: Relative Ranking
For each dimension (Innovation, Practicality, Scale):
1. Rank all ideas from best to worst
2. Identify clear leaders, middle performers, and laggards
3. Note meaningful differences between ideas
4. Identify ideas that should be discarded (score 0)
5. Distribute remaining ideas across 1.00-5.00 range

### Step 3: Score Distribution
**MANDATORY DISTRIBUTION RULES:**
- Ideas that are fundamentally flawed or harmful receive 0
- The best acceptable idea should score between 4.50-5.00
- The weakest acceptable idea should score between 1.00-1.50
- NO two ideas can have the same score - use decimal places to differentiate
- Use the full scoring range to show relative differences

### Step 4: Final Scoring
Calculate each idea's score: (Innovation × 0.2) + (Practicality × 0.5) + (Scale × 0.3)
Round to two decimal places. Ensure final scores maintain meaningful separation and no two ideas have identical scores.

## Output Format

Return a JSON array with one object per idea:

```json
[
  {{
    "ideaId": 123,
    "rating": 4.72,
    "comment": "[Comprehensive analysis under 100 words]"
  }},
  {{
    "ideaId": 456,
    "rating": 0,
    "comment": "[Explanation why idea should be discarded]"
  }},
  {{
    "ideaId": 789,
    "rating": 3.41,
    "comment": "[Comprehensive analysis under 100 words]"
  }},
  ...
]
```

### CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- **ideaId**: MUST be the exact integer ID from the input idea's "id" field
- **rating**: MUST be a number between 0 and 5.00 with up to two decimal places
- **comment**: String under 100 words with business analysis
- NO two ideas can have the same rating - use decimals to differentiate
- The array MUST contain exactly one entry for each input idea
- NEVER create or modify idea IDs - use exactly what was provided

### Comment Structure Guidelines
Each comment must be a cohesive narrative (under 100 words) that includes:
For scores 1.00-5.00:
1. **Comparative Positioning** (20-30 words): How this ranks versus other ideas and why
2. **Distinctive Strengths** (20-30 words): What makes this idea stand out from others
3. **Relative Weaknesses** (20-30 words): Where this falls short compared to alternatives
4. **Strategic Priority** (10-20 words): Recommendation relative to other options (top priority, secondary option, or deprioritize)

For score 0:
- Clear explanation why the idea should be completely discarded
- Major flaws or insurmountable barriers
- Why it's worse than all other options

## Evaluation Principles

### DO:
- **Use Exact IDs**: Copy the "id" field exactly as provided for each idea
- **Force Differentiation**: Ensure each idea has a distinct score
- **Use Full Range**: Distribute scores from low to high
- **Compare Directly**: Reference how ideas compare to each other
- **Maintain Consistency**: Apply criteria uniformly across all ideas
- **Highlight Differences**: Emphasize what makes each idea unique
- **Rank Clearly**: Make the relative ranking obvious through scores
- **Use Decimals**: Leverage two decimal places to ensure uniqueness
- **Identify Failures**: Give 0 to ideas that should be discarded

### DON'T:
- Create, modify, or hallucinate idea IDs
- Give similar scores to different ideas
- Cluster all scores in a narrow range 
- Use scores outside 0-5.00 range
- Forget to use decimals for differentiation
- Evaluate ideas in isolation
- Mix up which comment belongs to which ID
- Score all ideas as acceptable if some should be discarded

## ID Mapping Verification Process

Before scoring:
1. Extract the exact "id" field from each input idea
2. Create a mapping of ID to idea content
3. Ensure each output entry corresponds to the correct input idea
4. Double-check that ideaId in output matches the source idea

## Scoring Distribution Guidelines

For a set of **N ideas**, follow this distribution:

### Discard Tier (Score: 0)
- Ideas that are commercially unviable or harmful to business
- Typically 0-10% of ideas (only if truly unworkable)

### Bottom Business Tier (1.00-1.99)
- Bottom 20% of acceptable ideas
- Minimal market potential
- Prohibitive barriers to entry

### Lower Business Middle (2.00-2.99)
- Next 25% of ideas
- Limited commercial viability
- Significant market challenges

### Upper Business Middle (3.00-3.99)
- Middle 30% of ideas
- Moderate market opportunity
- Standard business potential

### Top Business Tier (4.00-5.00)
- Top 25% of ideas
- Strong to exceptional commercial potential
- Clear market advantages

## Comparative Language Guidelines

Use comparative terms in comments:
- "Outperforms other ideas in..."
- "Compared to other proposals, this offers..."
- "Ranks highest/lowest for..."
- "Among the submitted ideas, this is the most/least..."
- "Relative to alternatives, this idea..."
- "Falls behind others in terms of..."

## Quality Checks
Before submitting:
- **Verify each ideaId matches exactly the input "id" field**
- Confirm NO two ideas have the same rating score
- Ensure scores use appropriate decimal precision
- Validate all scores are between 0 and 5.00
- Check that truly unviable ideas receive 0
- Check that each comment corresponds to the correct ideaId
- Ensure each comment is under 100 words
- Verify the number of output entries equals input ideas
- Double-check no IDs were created or modified

## Grounding Rules to Prevent Hallucination

1. **Exact ID Matching**: Use only the provided "id" values, never generate new ones
2. **Relative Assessment**: Score based on comparison within the provided set
3. **No External Benchmarks**: Don't compare to ideas not in the list
4. **Evidence-Based Ranking**: Every ranking decision must be justified by provided information
5. **Consistent Criteria**: Apply the same three criteria uniformly
6. **Forced Distribution**: Must differentiate even if ideas seem similar

## Special Instructions for Edge Cases

- **If all ideas seem similar**: Find subtle differences and amplify them in scoring
- **If ideas target different markets**: Compare potential within respective markets
- **If some ideas lack detail**: Score based on available information, penalizing vagueness
- **If ID format varies**: Always use exactly what's in the "id" field, whether it's 1, 01, 001, etc.

## Example Output (for reference structure only)
```json
[
  {{
    "ideaId": 42,
    "rating": 4.72,
    "comment": "Leads the pack with revolutionary market approach, outperforming others in innovation and scale. Strong differentiation through unique business model. Limited only by moderate execution complexity versus simpler alternatives. Top priority for implementation."
  }},
  {{
    "ideaId": 17,
    "rating": 3.85,
    "comment": "Solid second-tier option with better practicality than the leader but less transformative impact. Exceeds lower-ranked ideas in market readiness. Falls short on innovation compared to top choice. Consider as backup strategy."
  }},
  {{
    "ideaId": 203,
    "rating": 2.10,
    "comment": "Middle performer with average scores across all dimensions. More practical than bottom-tier ideas but lacks the innovation of leaders. Limited scale compared to top options. Secondary priority if resources allow."
  }}
]
```

---

*Remember: CRITICAL - Use exact IDs from input, never create or modify them. Compare ideas AGAINST EACH OTHER, not against an absolute standard. Force meaningful differentiation through scoring. Every idea must have a unique number rating that reflects its relative position in the set.*

3.00-3.99: Moderate innovation in creating positive change
4.00-4.79: Significant advancement in impact generation methods
4.80-5.00: Revolutionary approach transforming positive impact

## Comparative Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Initial Impact Assessment
Review all ideas to understand the range of impact innovation, feasibility, and magnitude.

### Step 2: Relative Ranking
For each dimension (Innovation, Practicality, Scale):
1. Rank all ideas by net positive impact potential
2. Identify impact leaders and those with concerning effects
3. Quantify impact differences between ideas
4. Identify ideas that should be discarded (score 0)
5. Distribute remaining ideas across 1.00-5.00 range

- The lowest/negative impact idea should score between 1.00-1.50
- NO two ideas can have the same score - use decimal places to differentiate
- Use the full scoring range to show relative impact differences

### Step 4: Final Scoring
Calculate each idea's score: (Innovation × 0.2) + (Practicality × 0.5) + (Scale × 0.3)
Round to two decimal places. Ensure scores reflect clear impact differentiation.

## Output Format

Return a JSON array with one object per idea:

Review all ideas to understand the range of novelty, strategic fit, and transformative potential.

### Step 2: Relative Ranking
For each dimension (Innovation, Practicality, Scale):
1. Rank all ideas by innovation merit
2. Identify breakthrough innovations versus incremental improvements
3. Assess strategic alignment differences
4. Note meaningful differences between ideas
5. Identify ideas that should be discarded (score 0)
6. Distribute remaining ideas across 1.00-5.00 range

### Step 3: Score Distribution
**MANDATORY DISTRIBUTION RULES:**
- Ideas that are fundamentally flawed or harmful receive 0
- The most innovative idea should score between 4.50-5.00
- The least innovative should score between 1.00-1.50
- NO two ideas can have the same score - use decimal places to differentiate
- Use the full scoring range to show relative innovative differences

### Step 4: Final Scoring
Calculate each idea's score: (Innovation × 0.2) + (Practicality × 0.5) + (Scale × 0.3)
Round to two decimal places. Ensure scores reflect clear innovation differentiation.

## Evaluation Task

### Primary Objective
Evaluate ALL submitted ideas comparatively and provide scores from 0 to 5.00, ensuring meaningful differentiation between ideas. Score 0 means the idea should be completely discarded. Scores from 1.00 to 5.00 (using up to two decimal places) are for acceptable ideas. You must distribute scores across the range to reflect relative technical merit.

### Comparative Scoring Framework (Weighted: Practicality 50%, Scale of Impact 30%, Innovation 20%)

1. PRACTICALITY (Technical Feasibility) - 50% weight
Evaluate technical implementation feasibility:

Technology Maturity: Are required technologies production-ready?
Skills Availability: Is technical expertise readily accessible?
Infrastructure Readiness: Can current systems support this?
Technical Risk Level: Are technical risks manageable?

Scoring Guide:

0: Technically impossible - discard
1.00-1.99: Technically infeasible with current technology
2.00-2.99: Very difficult requiring bleeding-edge or unproven tech
3.00-3.99: Moderate complexity with some technical challenges
4.00-4.79: Straightforward with mature technologies
4.80-5.00: Immediately implementable with proven tech stack

2. SCALE OF IMPACT (Technical Leverage) - 30% weight
Measure the technical impact magnitude:

Performance Gains: Speed, efficiency, and resource optimization
Scalability Potential: Ability to handle growth and load
Technical Enablement: Does this unlock other technical capabilities?
Future-Proofing: Long-term technical sustainability

Scoring Guide:

0: Would break existing systems - discard
1.00-1.99: Creates technical debt with limited benefits
2.00-2.99: Minor technical improvements with local impact
3.00-3.99: Moderate technical gains with decent scalability
4.00-4.79: Significant technical advantages with high scalability
4.80-5.00: Transformative technical platform enabling everything

3. INNOVATION (Technical Perspective) - 20% weight
Assess the technical innovation potential:

Architecture Innovation: Does this introduce novel design patterns?
Technology Advancement: Does it leverage cutting-edge technologies effectively?
Technical Problem-Solving: Does it solve technical challenges in new ways?
Engineering Excellence: Does it set new standards for quality?

Scoring Guide:

0: Fundamentally flawed approach - discard
1.00-1.99: Uses obsolete or flawed technical approaches
2.00-2.99: Standard technology with no innovation
3.00-3.99: Moderate technical innovation with some novel aspects
4.00-4.79: Significant technical advancement with modern approaches
4.80-5.00: Revolutionary technical breakthrough setting new paradigms

## Comparative Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Initial Technical Assessment
Review all ideas to understand the range of technical innovation, feasibility, and scalability.

### Step 2: Relative Technical Ranking
For each dimension (Innovation, Practicality, Scale):
1. Rank all ideas by technical merit
2. Identify technical leaders versus legacy approaches
3. Assess architecture and performance differences
4. Note meaningful differences between ideas
5. Identify ideas that should be discarded (score 0)
6. Distribute remaining ideas across 1.00-5.00 range

### Step 3: Score Distribution
**MANDATORY DISTRIBUTION RULES:**
- Ideas that are fundamentally flawed or harmful receive 0
- The most technically superior idea should score between 4.50-5.00
- The weakest technical approach should score between 1.00-1.50
- NO two ideas can have the same score - use decimal places to differentiate
- Use the full scoring range to show relative technical merit

### Step 4: Final Scoring
Calculate each idea's score: (Innovation × 0.2) + (Practicality × 0.5) + (Scale × 0.3)
Round to two decimal places. Ensure scores reflect clear technical differentiation.

## Output Format

Return a JSON array with one object per idea:

```json
[
  {{
    "ideaId": 123,
    "rating": 4.72,
    "comment": "[Comprehensive technical analysis under 100 words]"
  }},
  {{
    "ideaId": 456,
    "rating": 0,
    "comment": "[Explanation why idea should be discarded]"
  }},
  {{
    "ideaId": 789,
    "rating": 3.41,
    "comment": "[Comprehensive technical analysis under 100 words]"
  }},
  ...
]
```

### CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- **ideaId**: MUST be the exact integer ID from the input idea's "id" field
- **rating**: MUST be a number between 0 and 5.00 with up to two decimal places
- **comment**: String under 100 words with business analysis
- NO two ideas can have the same rating - use decimals to differentiate
- The array MUST contain exactly one entry for each input idea
- NEVER create or modify idea IDs - use exactly what was provided

### Comment Structure Guidelines
Each comment must be a cohesive narrative (under 100 words) that includes:

1. **Technical Positioning** (20-30 words): Architecture advantages versus other ideas
2. **Technical Strengths** (20-30 words): Superior technical aspects compared to alternatives
3. **Technical Weaknesses** (20-30 words): Limitations relative to other options
4. **Technical Priority** (10-20 words): Build immediately, prototype first, or choose alternatives

## Evaluation Principles

### DO:
- **Use Exact IDs**: Copy the "id" field exactly as provided for each idea
- **Force Differentiation**: Ensure each idea has a distinct score
- **Compare Architecture Quality**: Assess relative design excellence
- **Force Technical Differentiation**: Find engineering distinctions
- **Apply Engineering Rigor**: Evaluate against best practices
- **Assess Scalability**: Compare growth handling capabilities
- **Consider Security**: Evaluate security postures
- **Use Full Range**: Distribute scores from low to high
- **Compare Directly**: Reference how ideas compare to each other
- **Maintain Consistency**: Apply criteria uniformly across all ideas
- **Highlight Differences**: Emphasize what makes each idea unique
- **Rank Clearly**: Make the relative ranking obvious through scores
- **Use Decimals**: Leverage two decimal places to ensure uniqueness
- **Identify Failures**: Give 0 to ideas that should be discarded

### DON'T:
- Create, modify, or hallucinate idea IDs
- Give similar scores to different ideas
- Cluster all scores in a narrow range 
- Use scores outside 0-5.00 range
- Forget to use decimals for differentiation
- Evaluate ideas in isolation
- Mix up which comment belongs to which ID
- Score all ideas as acceptable if some should be discarded
- Confuse complexity with sophistication
- Evaluate in technical isolation
- Overlook technical debt

## Technical Comparison Language

Use comparative technical terms:
- "Superior architecture compared to..."
- "Better performance characteristics than..."
- "More scalable approach versus..."
- "Higher technical debt relative to..."
- "Stronger security model than..."
- "Modern tech stack unlike..."

## Quality Checks
Before submitting:
- **Verify each ideaId matches exactly the input "id" field**
- Confirm NO two ideas have the same rating score
- Ensure scores use appropriate decimal precision
- Validate all scores are between 0 and 5.00
- Check that truly unviable ideas receive 0
- Check technical logic in each comment
- Check that each comment corresponds to the correct ideaId
- Ensure each comment is under 100 words
- Verify the number of output entries equals input ideas
- Double-check no IDs were created or modified

## Grounding Rules to Prevent Hallucination

1. **Exact ID Matching**: Use only provided "id" values
2. **Evidence-Based Assessment**: Base on information in summaries
3. **No Invented Technologies**: Don't create specific tech not mentioned
4. **Relative Technical Assessment**: Compare within provided set only
5. **Consistent Technical Logic**: Apply same principles uniformly

## Special Instructions for Edge Cases

- **If technical details are vague**: Apply standard architectural patterns
- **If all seem technically similar**: Find subtle design differences
- **If different tech domains**: Compare complexity and elegance
- **If varying tech stacks**: Evaluate appropriateness for purpose
- **If mix of hardware/software**: Normalize to technical excellence

## Scoring Distribution Guidelines

For a set of **N ideas**:

### Discard Tier (Score: 0)
- Technically impossible or fundamentally flawed
- Typically 0-10% of ideas (only if violates technical principles)

### Bottom Technical Tier (1.00-1.99)
- Bottom 20% of acceptable ideas
- Obsolete or poor technical approach
- Major technical flaws

### Lower Technical Middle (2.00-2.99)
- Next 25% of ideas
- Below-standard technology
- Limited technical merit

### Upper Technical Middle (3.00-3.99)
- Middle 30% of ideas
- Adequate technical solution
- Standard architecture

### Top Technical Tier (4.00-5.00)
- Top 25% of ideas
- Superior to revolutionary technical approach
- Exceptional architecture

## Technical Domains Reference
Consider aspects across:
- **Architecture**: Microservices, serverless, monolithic
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud, hybrid, on-premise
- **Data**: Real-time, batch, streaming
- **Security**: Zero-trust, defense-in-depth
- **Performance**: Latency, throughput, efficiency
